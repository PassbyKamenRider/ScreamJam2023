    textResponse: The room is dimly lit, with only a faint light coming from the
      door behind you, but it's enough for you to see the entire surroundings. Directly
      in front of you is a <b>white door</b>, which seems to be the way out. There
      are also a <b>black door</b> on the left, a <b>yellow door</b> on the right,
      and a <b>red door</b> behind you. This room appears to only have a <b>couch</b>.
